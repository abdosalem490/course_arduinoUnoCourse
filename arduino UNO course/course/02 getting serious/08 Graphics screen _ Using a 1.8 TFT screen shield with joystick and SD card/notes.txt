also make sure that the result BMP image has a dimesions that is equal or less than to that of your touch screen and to see the dimensions of the screen , right click on the image and select properties and see the dimensions tab
alternative way to that is to make a PNG file using photoshop for example , as PNG file is 32 bit BMP file (8 bit for Red , 8 bit for green , 8 bot for blue , 8 bit for transparency)
that library we are using made by Adafruit can handle 8 bit color but without that 8 bit for transparency , so when exporting your PNG file in photoshop , turn off Transparency box so that it have a 3 - 8bit channel not 4.
